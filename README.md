# TCP-Multithreaded-Socket-Communication
A TCP communication network where the server can communicate with multiple clients and multiple clients can communicate with the server. Clients have the ability to send text files to the server which creates a new text file with the text file information. Clients also have the ability to send generic messages to the server. Server utilizes a hash table in order to store previous clients and for fast searching. This programs was an individual project that was created in order to better understand TCP communication protocols as well as solidify understanding in Windows Forms and C#.
